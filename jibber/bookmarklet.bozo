### Pitahaya bookmarklet
~~~
Drag the following bookmarklet [Pitahaya v.0](js) ‚Üê to your bookmark bar and try it on this youtube video: [https://youtu.be/GyATVQ8Y57Y](https://youtu.be/GyATVQ8Y57Y).
~~~
When you are on any youtube video that is playing an mp3-encoded pitahaya video (the maximum resolution of the video will be 360p) click the bookmark and
a little player will open in the top left corner.
Click play and it will automatically begin to decode and play the video.
~~~
Notes: Because of some browser limitations, the bookmarklet is somewhat unpractical for casual use, and only mp3 decoding is supported for now.
Be sure not to tab away or minimize the browser when a video is playing -- that will cause the decoding mechanism to stop working.
You can drag a tab playing the youtube video out to its own dedicated browser window and hide it off screen if necessary.

The bookmarklet has been tested on both chrome and firefox on windows. The [source](http://github.com/fanfare/pitahaya/bookmarklet) is also available.
